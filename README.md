# TrailRecommendationF22
Files from a trail recommendation project using data from AllTrails

Jupyter Notebook with the trail recommendation system is 'Final Trail Recommendation Project.ipynb', 
and the dataset is stored in a file called 'nationalparktrails.csv' which is from kaggle.

There is a dashboard adaptation of this code in progress in the 'Dashboard Adaptation' folder, but it is not yet complete.
